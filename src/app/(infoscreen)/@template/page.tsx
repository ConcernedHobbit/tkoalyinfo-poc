/*
Steps for creating a new slide
- Implement content here
- Implement loading and error pages
- Implement data fetching as a server action in @/server if the data updates infrequently
    in order to minimize work the dinky rasberry client has to do
- If the data needs to update frequently e.g. transit it may me better to do it client side
    to not call the TKO-Ã¤ly backend thousands of times per day
- Add slide to ../layout
- Add possible revalidation interval to ../page
